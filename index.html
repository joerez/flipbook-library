WELCOME TO THE SOURCE CODE!

This should walk you through how to set up a flipbook for yourself. Feel free to copy and paste
everything from the bookContainer div onward. That will get you started.

Also follow the comments in the book.css and book.js files.

If anything is unclear, please leave an issue in the github repository: https://github.com/joerez/flipbook-library

Happy flipping!
- Joe Rezendes
